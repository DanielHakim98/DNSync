# DNSync
An peer-to-peer synchorinzation tool designed to synchronize /etc/hosts across some or all nodes in a Tailscale tailnet without relying on Tailscale MagicDNS or external DNS services.

This is an attempt to solve my tailnet DNS resolving issue where my tailnet does not have any centralized local DNS record.
To be honest, I believe there are already some tools that could solve this problem, but I just decide, why not try to built my own, and then just do trial and error until I give up
with my own custom solution.
